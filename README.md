# ec2-iam-users

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diogenes1oliveira/ec2-iam-users.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diogenes1oliveira/ec2-iam-users)

Ansible role to provide IAM based SSH access to EC2 instances

This role was originally inspired by this Medium post
[SSH Authentication with AuthorizedKeysCommand](https://medium.com/@jryancanty/just-in-time-ssh-provisioning-7b20d9736a07).

## Instance Requirements

- The EC2 instances must be using YUM-derived Linux AMIs.
- A minimum set of policies that must be attached to the instances is given in
  [iam-ec2-policy.yml](files/iam-ec2-policy.yml)

## Controller Requirements

- To install the dependencies on the controller node, run
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dependencies

No extra role or external module is required.

## Role Variables

# defaults/main.yml

# Name of the group to fetch the users from

```yaml
# vars/main.yml
